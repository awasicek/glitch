Glitch is part game, part story, and part website.  My goal with this project is to create a story-rich, emotionally-evocative, interactive experience that would create the illusion of communicating with an artificial intelligence.  This is my attempt to create a piece of art with code.

The long-term goal of the project is to create an experience where a user can make choices as to how to interact with Glitch, and these choices will be reflected in consequences in the story as well as the look and feel of the site.

Given the limited time period for implementing the project, right now this web application serves as the foundation for creating and delivering the story and experience of Glitch.  In other words, the site is currently functioning as a proof of concept.  As time allows, I plan on writing the story and mapping out the branching nature of user choices and the resultant consequences.

This is just the beginning.  Glitch is an embryo right now -- the infrastructure is present -- and by adding narrative content this application can grow to fruition.

##How to Use

Sign up for an account on the site and then login.  

Ready to get to know a new entity? Visit [Glitch](https://glitch-app.herokuapp.com/) to get started. Have fun!


##User Stories
As a user, I want the experience to be immersive and create an illusion that I am actually interacting with a computer consciousness.

As a user, I want to feel like my choices make a difference.

As a user, I want the site to be clean, simple, and easy to navigate.

As a user, I want my progress in the Glitch story (and my choices) to be saved so that I can come back to the site later and pick up where I left off.


##Future Implementations
* Write an interesting and compelling branching story with meaningful choices and consequences.
* Add flash messages so that user knows why a login, signup, etc. failed or succeeded.
* Feed Glitch's dialogue to a text-to-speech API to further bring the application to life.
* Mobile-friendly.
* Add ability for Glitch to send a user SMS text messages or emails so that it appears that Glitch is an actual artificial entity that is not limited to the four corners of the Glitch website.
* Consume social media APIs so that Glitch can make comments specific to the user.
* Utilize cognitive and machine learning APIs such as IBM's Watson or Microsoft's Cognitive Services to allow some dynamic interactions with Glitch.  In other words, provide the ability to interact occasionally with Glitch in a way that is more than selecting a dialogue option.
